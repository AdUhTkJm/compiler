## C Compiler

A small C compiler inspired by 9cc.
See [my blog](https://aduhtkjm.wordpress.com/) for explanation.

#### Implementation Progress

1. plus and minus operators.

2. multiplication, brackets and return statement.

3. functions and int-typed variables.

4. global variables.

5. function calls.

6. if-, while- and for-statements; comparison operators.

7. compound operators (+=, -= etc). long, short and char.

8. basic semantics checking; pointers.

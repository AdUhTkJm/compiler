## C Compiler

A small C compiler inspired by 9cc.
See [my blog](https://aduhtkjm.wordpress.com/) for explanation.

#### Implementation Progress

1. Added ability to evaluate plus and minus.

2. Added multiplication, brackets and return statement.

3. Added functions and int-typed variables.

4. Added global variables.
Changed assembly syntax to NASM, since intel_syntax noprefix is not well-documented.

5. Added function calls.

6. Added if-, while- and for-statements.
Added comparison operators.

7. Added a series of operators (+=, -= etc).
Added long, short and char.
